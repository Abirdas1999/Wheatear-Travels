                      An 'Overseas tour package' refers to any package facilitating travel to countries outside India, covering expenses like travel, accommodation, boarding, or similar expenditures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A 'Specified Person' is defined under Section 206CCA(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

                    <p>
                      Users are liable to pay Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on the booking of an 'Overseas tour package' at the prescribed rate, in addition to the package price, as per Section 206C (1G)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. WT will collect and remit this TCS to the Government, issuing the necessary documents to users in compliance with these provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Users must provide their valid PAN details at the time of booking. WT will verify the PAN provided to ensure compliance with Section 206CC of the Income Tax Act. Non-compliance or invalid PANs may lead to booking cancellation, with refunds processed according to the applicable cancellation policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, WT will verify PANs under Section 206CCA of the Income Tax Act. If the user qualifies as a 'Specified Person' upon verification, they must pay TCS at the higher applicable rate. Failure to pay may result in booking cancellation, with refunds handled as per the cancellation policy.

                      The RBI requires PAN details for all transactions under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), including any international bookings made on the Website or through Sales Channels. The User guarantees that the PAN details for the User/traveler will be provided by the prescribed cut-off date set by WT, either at the time of booking or afterward. If the traveler is a minor, WT will require the PAN details of the parent or guardian. Failure to comply may result in the cancellation of the booking.

                    <p>
                      The User also confirms that the total amount of foreign exchange purchased or remitted during the current financial year from all sources in India, including the current transaction, falls within the RBI’s permissible limit. If this limit is exceeded before the actual remittance request is approved by the AD Bank, WT must cancel the booking in compliance with the law and process a refund according to the applicable cancellation policy. The User further confirms that any foreign exchange purchased for the purpose of international travel under the current booking will be used for the stated purpose.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                    For the purpose of calculating tour costs or refunds, foreign exchange components will be based on the prevailing exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates may result in changes to the tour cost or refund amount, and Users agree to bear any such differences.

                    <h4>
                    Refunds
                    </h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    WT acts as a facilitator, and any refund for undelivered services by service providers or contractors is contingent upon WT receiving the refund from the service provider. Users acknowledge that WT is not responsible for delays or non-refund of amounts from these entities and should directly contact the service provider for any claims.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    If Users make changes to their accommodation during the Outbound Tour, WT will not refund or compensate in any manner. Users are also liable for any additional costs arising from such changes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    In case of delays in refunds beyond the specified period, WT’s liability is limited to refunding the amount with interest calculated at the applicable bank rate until the refund date.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                    Amendments
                    </h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    If WT amends or alters a tour or holiday after booking, Users may choose to continue with the amended tour, accept an alternative tour offered by WT, or opt for a refund of the tour cost (after deducting actual expenses incurred by WT such as visa, insurance premium, and other applicable charges). WT is not liable for any damages, additional expenses, or consequential losses in such cases.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    WT is not obligated to provide a breakdown of the invoice for each service included in the package under any circumstance.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                    Promotions & Discounts
                    </h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    WT may periodically introduce promotional offers and discounts on tour packages, whether through internal channels or external advertisements. Some Users on group tours may receive additional benefits based on their entitlement to these promotions and discounts. Users in the group cannot claim these privileges if they are not eligible or entitled under the promotion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    If WT publishes any travel scheme offering discounts or benefits, WT reserves the sole right to withdraw such schemes or discounts at any time.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                    Tour Arrangements & Other Activities
                    </h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    For tour arrangements such as carnivals, cosmos tours, star cruises, amusement parks, museums, etc., the terms and conditions specified by these respective entities will also apply.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    Users are responsible for arriving at the tour’s starting point and registering with WT’s representative, tour guide, or tour manager at the designated place, date, and time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    If a User utilizes pre-tour services or part of them, including air tickets (included in the main tour cost), but fails to join the main tour group at the designated place or cancels the tour after using these services, it will be considered a “no-show,” and there will be no refund for the unused pre-tour or main tour services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                    WT cannot be held responsible for any risks to the health, safety, or well-being of Users during activities such as adventure sports, amusement park rides, ferry rides, sightseeing, or any other potentially hazardous activities undertaken as part of or independently during the Outbound Tour. Any loss, injury, accident, or other incidents arising from such activities are solely at the User’s risk and liability attributable to WT.
